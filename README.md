The MSAL library for iOS and macOS gives your app the ability to begin using the [Microsoft Identity platform](https://aka.ms/aaddev) by supporting [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) and [Microsoft Accounts](https://account.microsoft.com) in a converged experience using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. The library also supports [Azure AD B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory-b2c/) for those using our hosted identity management service.
