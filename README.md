# Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for iOS
=====================================

## Our new SDK is under development!

MSAL for ObjC is in active development, but not yet ready. We encourage you to look at our work in progress and provide feedback! 

It should not be used in production environments. Currently only iOS is supported. Even though a macOS library builds, it does not currently work. macOS support will come later.
